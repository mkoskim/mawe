In order to run Mawe on Windows machines, you will need Python3 with
GTK3 libraries and bindings. Unfortunately it is not as straightforward
as one could hope.

First, install MSYS2, with Python3 and GTK3. There are installation
instructions at pygobject website:

https://pygobject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#windows-getting-started

Run MSYS2 shell either from command line, or use "MSYS2 MinGW 64-bit"
option in the start menu. You can access Windows folders from "/c"
folder, for example, your Windows home directory is "/c/Users/<account>"
To ease the use, you may want to create symlinks to MSYS2 user folder.

When you have installed Python and GTK3, install GTKSourceView:

$ pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gtksourceview4

Now you should be able to run the editor. Windows support is
incomplete, but I try to improve it. For example, fonts may not work,
and there are some quirks in SourceView cursor (it is invisible time
to time).
