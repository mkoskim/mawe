MAWE
====

MAWE - Advanced Writer's Editor - written with Python.

Keep in mind, that this is also sketching for web version.

---

Mawe is based on Moe (https://github.com/mkoskim/moe). Moe itself is very usable editor for writers, and it has been my workhorse for years. Even that it handles certain things better than e.g. Scrivener (in my opinion), it has certain drawbacks, which come from the very fundamental design principles.

Mawe is a text editor project for writers, which tries to fix the problems in moe by taking a different approach at very basic level.

Moe, as well as most of the writer's editors - scrivener, storybook, ywriter, ... - nowadays in the market, is based on the hierarchial list of "scenes", an undividable piece of text. The idea sounds good, BUT a story, a book, is not like that. A book is a sequence of characters, a sequence of scenes and chapters. That is what you want to create. Not an hierarchy of scenes, groups, parts and such, but a sequence of characters. That is why I decided to start develop mawe.
