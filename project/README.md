Project Management
==================

Completing a story is a project. It has all the characteristics of
projects in other areas, like design, deadlines and such. Many, if
not most writers have all the time several on-going story projects,
and thus there is a need to keep them organized.

Integrating project management to a writing tool sounds very useful
to me. I made simple project manager for my MOE editor, and it has
been very useful.

This time I want to go bit further with the idea. I try to borrow ideas
from regular project management tools, such as GitHub repository
project tab.

Project management issues:

- Worklists and projects: for example, picking few most promising
  unfinished stories for writing competition.

Not only stories need to be kept somehow organized, but all sorts of
background information, too. For many stories, you do lots of studying
and planning, and many times these are valuable for other stories, too.

Storage support
---------------

Objective here is to integrate different means to store your work
together, namely:

- Local files

- Dropbox

- Google Drive

I would prefer different kinds of network drives because then your
stories are available everywhere. It greatly helps writing process.
