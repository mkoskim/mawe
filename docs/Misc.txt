Some miscellaneous toughts about the editor.

Guidelines, checklists, ... - can we create a library, where you can include
the snippet you want? For example, you might like to fit your story in the:

- Snowflake method

- Algis Burdys structure:
  (1) character, (2) background, (3) problem,
  (4) first try to solve the problem, that fails, because character does not
  yet know enough from the problem,
  (5) second attempt, with more knowledge, which will fail, and
  (6) third and final attempt, "all in", which then leads to
  (7) end.
