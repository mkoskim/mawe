Some miscellaneous toughts about the editor.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Worksets:

- Remember: It is important to be able to access "idea pages" quickly during
  writing! So that when you are writing and you come up with an idea that
  could relate to some other story, you could write it down quickly and go
  back writing the story.

About title:

- Story has global title

- Title can be overridden by sections: That is, it is possible that different
  versions have different name. We preserve that, so that you can come back
  to earlier version and print it out as it was when you edited it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Guidelines, checklists, ... - can we create a library, where you can include
the snippet you want? For example, you might like to fit your story in the:

- Snowflake method

- Algis Burdys structure:
  (1) character, (2) background, (3) problem,
  (4) first try to solve the problem, that fails, because character does not
  yet know enough from the problem,
  (5) second attempt, with more knowledge, which will fail, and
  (6) third and final attempt, "all in", which then leads to
  (7) end.
