Storage Management
==================

Objective here is to integrate different means to store your work
together, namely:

- Local files

- Dropbox

- Google Drive

I would prefer different kinds of network drives because then your
stories are available everywhere. It greatly helps writing process.

Storage management is one aspect in project manager. I desperately
need better tools for organizing writing projects than what I
currently have.

Project management issues:

- Worklists and projects: for example, picking few most promising
  unfinished stories for writing competition.
