DONE:

- DONE: Remember the directory where you were on open file directory between
  restarts. Not Done: Make it default to home directory - os.path does not
  regocnize "~", so it defaults to cwd().
  
- DONE: Project manager: It is first enough to have mawe files in moe project
  manager. But for workspaces and tabbed editing, we need built-in project
  manager.

- DONE: Remember opened files

- DONE: Project search path

- DONE: Integrated project manager

- DONE: Also comments and missing word counts to project manager, to tell some
  idea of the status of the text.

- DONE: Save: Get name suggestion from title

- DONE: Save list of open tabs for restoring: remember check errors

- DONE: FIX: We now scan directory twice at start up

- DONE: FIX: Refresh does not update word count in project manager???

- DONE: When we have loaded a moe file, it would be good if mawe would suggest
  to save it to same direction with .mawe extension. At least it could start
  from that directory. Lets make it so, that "Save" works as "Save as" if
  the file does not exist yet.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- DONE: Interesting... It is much more difficult to import text, latex and RTF
  files directly to mawe as it was with moe - ah, I was wrong. It was not
  hard at all. Just looked that at first glance.

- DONE: It could be good, if first line would be reserved for title. Now, this
  title needs to be updated to either header, or to part. Well, tested it and
  not necessarily...

- DONE: Many current software have combined open/new window. Many of them are
  interesting and full of action. There's many ways to open things
  (open folder, clone from repo, choose recent, start new). It wouldn't
  be bad idea, right?
  
  * Absolutely this feature, new button inside open dialog.

- DONE: Gtk: Box packer (for easing box creations)

- DONE: Header info editor

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- DONE: Key combinations, e.g. Alt-A + Alt-F -> Fold all

- DONE: Fold / Unfold all

- FIXED: Move line (Alt-up, alt-down) does not work with markers. Moving
  header line over another will duplicate the mark.

  We now remove marks from updated regions, and recreate them after update.

- FIXED: (Fix available) GtkSourceView crashes randomly!!! Errors like this:
  (mawe.py:10556): Gtk-WARNING **: /build/gtk+3.0-2Ut_nl/gtk+3.0-3.18.9/./gtk/gtktextbtree.c:4034: byte index off the end of the line

  (mawe.py:10556): Gtk-ERROR **: Byte index 1362 is off the end of the line
  Trace/breakpoint trap

- DONE: Import .moe files to get content for testing

- DONE: Visible word/character counts from doc

- DONE: Initial configs (to save window size)

- DONE: Loading moe files in mawe format. Ready for saving.

- DONE: Add UUID to file format, so that project manager recognizes files even
  if they are moved.
  
- DONE: File loading

- DONE: Changed-mark: Ask to save modified files when exiting.

- DONE: # TODO: Track somehow if the file was really loaded from filename,
        # or if it was created when converting files. If Document was created
        # by conversion, still ask filename when attempting to save (although
        # we have here suggestion for it)

- DONE: (it is br now) psep (paragraph separator) is missing from the files! Maybe
  empty "<p />" is enough? It is not. We need a separator.

- DONE: File saving (file format): Don't save & load files in markup format
  used in editor. It can change in future.

- DONE: We could add UUID to moe files, too. UUID could help linking documents
  together.

- DONE: Try detachable tabs. Not good.
