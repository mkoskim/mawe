WORKLIST

- Moving folded scenes around: Alt-up, Alt-down. We can allow cutting entire
  folded scenes, but not parts of them.

- FIX: Pressing ESC when asked if to save modified file results "Discard"

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TODO:

- PM: Asynchronous directory scan: in case it takes a lots of time.

- PM: Add context menu to open folder and with text editor.

- Export: Texifier to version control

- Export: File export: RTF, tex (for texifier)

- Revert: Make it load tree from file if doc has origin. This is for cases
  where file has changed in the disk.

- Move listview's selected row when moving around the text

- Text <-> List swapping using Alt-left/right (instead of Alt-1/2 used at the
  moment)

- Selecting & moving scenes in listview

- We could preserve e.g. "## **" to 'chapter' header. In fact, we need to
  make chapters. Just to prevent me using scenes as decorating items.

- Settings editor

- Style editor: font, colors, ... - would be great to tailor the view for
  the computer (monitor size and so on)

- FIX: Scroll to mark after unfold does not work.

- Sticky pages? So that you could create your own checklists and such.

- Author and nickname could be behind radiobuttons, so that you can quickly
  switch between them.

- File open: Recursive file search like in nautilus

- File open: Add recent files
  
- File open: Allow users to make directories and create new files: now, if you
  make a new file, you first press New and then save it to correct
  folder with wanted name.

- When starting Mawe first time (no config yet), make it open user's guide.

- Let user choose what tab to open on startup (where I left, open file,
  new, project manager)

- Some sort of "loopback" device to test file saving and loading:
  save a file, and load it back to editor. It would be great if that
  would be as complete chain as possible. I have experience how nasty
  bugs are if they are in the document save part, making corrupted files.

- Drag'n'drop mawe and moe files to editor. In case you work with file
  manager or similar.

- Cursor marks? For example, Alt-1 to place a mark, and Shit-Alt-1 to go
  back.

- History entry to file: This can be used to track history, e.g.
  writing competitions where the text has been sent. <notes> part
  could be perfect for this!!!

- Add error handling when loading documents

- When choosing with grab, show the selections in the listbox

- Search and replace: it is very useful feature I have missed in moe a lot

- Separate configs to local and global ones. For example, you may want
  to store workset configurations to a shared drive, but keep window settings
  on local machine.

- Improvements to Open/New View: many current software have it nicely
  decorated.

- A synopsis editor (and index cards) would be cool, I think. I already
  sketched it with moe, but it has been underused.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

QUIRKS, FIX:

- We can not just switch buffer to textview - Undo/redo will not work in
  that case. Instead, when switching buffers, we need to create new views.

- Cut & paste scene headers has quirks: Consider these:

  * Cancel cut and paste, if selection contains protected areas
    (folded scenes)
    
  * Except if selection bounds are at scene bounds, that is, you
    have selected entire scenes.
    
- Make:

  * Ctrl-up, Ctrl-down: move paragraph up / down
  
  * Alt-up, Alt-down: move scene up / down - if you have selections
    (preferably whole scenes), move scenes with cursor.

- I need to figure out suitable mechanics for managing hidden text tags.
  Whenever the scene header with "folded" mark is detached from hidden
  text, the hide tag should be removed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

POSTPONED:

- We can now support just one-part files

- We don't need versioning yet.

- We can live without being able to mix buffers from several
  documents together in one view. That is, it is enough if we can choose
  between doc's draft and notes buffers.

- Packed format: .mawe.gz - use gzip module to pack and unpack.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DONE:

- DONE: Notes available to right side with index (to help working with them)

- DONE: FIX: Focus left / right
