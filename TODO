FEATURES needed to start using the editor in daily work:

- File saving (file format): Don't save & load files in markup format
  used in editor. It can change in future.

- File loading / project manager: It is first enough to have mawe files
  in moe project manager. But for workspaces and tabbed editing, we need
  built-in project manager.

- File export: RTF, text (for texifier)

- Settings

- Header info editor

- Changed-mark: Ask to save modified files when exiting.

- Postpone: We can now support just one-part files

- Postpone: We don't need versioning yet.

Other features:

- Search and replace: it is very useful feature I have missed in moe a lot

- Separate configs to local and global ones. For example, you may want
  to store workset configurations to a shared drive, but keep window settings
  on local machine.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FIX:

- We need reimplement Alt-Up/Down to move scenes, not lines.

- Cut & paste scene headers has quirks: we might need to remove
  protection tag before cutting

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

QUIRKS ETC:

- I need to figure out suitable mechanics for managing hidden text tags.
  Whenever the scene header with "folded" mark is detached from hidden
  text, the hide tag should be removed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TODO:

- Move listview selected row when moving around the text

- Selecting & moving scenes in listview

- Texifier to version control

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DONE:

- DONE: Key combinations, e.g. Alt-A + Alt-F -> Fold all

- DONE: Fold / Unfold all

- FIXED: Move line (Alt-up, alt-down) does not work with markers. Moving
  header line over another will duplicate the mark.

  We now remove marks from updated regions, and recreate them after update.

- FIXED: (Fix available) GtkSourceView crashes randomly!!! Errors like this:
  (mawe.py:10556): Gtk-WARNING **: /build/gtk+3.0-2Ut_nl/gtk+3.0-3.18.9/./gtk/gtktextbtree.c:4034: byte index off the end of the line

  (mawe.py:10556): Gtk-ERROR **: Byte index 1362 is off the end of the line
  Trace/breakpoint trap

- DONE: Import .moe files to get content for testing

- DONE: Visible word/character counts from doc

- DONE: Initial configs (to save window size)
