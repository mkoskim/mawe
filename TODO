WORKLIST

- Clipboard? Try out clipboard (Alt-X to move scene in it, Alt-V to paste scenes
  from clipboard) to ease scene moving. Store clipboard to file (notes section?).

- Bake synopses to scene header? For example "Scene: Synopsis" - I thought to
  give writer a freedom to place synopses anywhere s/he likes, but it could
  be better to keep them with scene header? Currently, synopses are heavily
  underused feature.

- A synopsis editor (and index cards) for outlining the story structure would be cool,
  I think. I already sketched it with moe, but it has been underused.

- F2 to rename doc (or file?)

- Export: Version number to cover page when exporting: would be great when
  exchanging text with editors.

- Export: Convert _ and * to bold and italic in files.

- Setting fonts & colors: its important for different computers with
  different screen sizes.

  * Settings editor

  * Style editor: font, colors, ... - would be great to tailor the view for
    the computer (monitor size and so on)

- Search and replace: it is very useful feature I have missed in moe a lot,
  for example when changing names in stories.

- Selecting & moving scenes in listview

- Moving folded scenes around: Shift-Alt-up, Shift-Alt-down. We can allow
  cutting entire folded scenes, but not parts of them.

- When choosing with grab, show the selections in the listbox? Or implement
  a separate clipboard for cutted scenes?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FEATURE IMPROVEMENTS:

- Put file name in to the Title section. Possibly make it possible to
  rename the file from title.

- It should be possible to make a draft to a version, and get that version
  sided with the new one. This is needed when rewriting the story. It should
  be possible to easily switch between old version, new version and notes.

- We'd need heavily improve parts and such. It should be possible to
  write parts of the story separately, and then move it to draft. For
  example, in many longer stories, you have a side path you want to write
  separately, and then later merge it to main line.
  
- Improve moving text between parts (draft and notes)

- Improve notes. Notes are - or can be - different to draft. Notes are more
  like a card pile you want to keep organized.

- Would there be some use for "lorem" -thingie, so that: you can set how
  many words you want to write to certain scene. It will be filled by
  lorem-generator, and that word count will be in grey. While you write, you
  keep replacing lorem with your own words. This would be sort of
  "visualization" of your word goals.

- It would be nice, if you could move selected text between left & right
  buffers, like this: (1) select a text, (2) switch to left/right side, (3)
  locate a good place, (4) move selection to that place. It would be great
  when cutting text to be used later, and then moving it back to text.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROJECTS AND PROGRESSING:

- Start recording words and progress. Save word progression to file, and
  make some small graphs how things has been progressed. I am mostly
  interest if comments come to plain text, and how much words do red
  paragprahs produce.

- History entry to file: This can be used to track history, e.g.
  writing competitions where the text has been sent. <notes> part
  could be perfect for this!!!

- Last modified timestamp to project view.

- Sort options for project view

- Worksets: Sketch how worksets could work - how to make and use them? The
  goal: you could have several different sets of stories, somehow related to
  each other, which you could easily manage. For example, you might have
  a set of three short stories telling about the same character, and you
  would like to keep them together including the meta (plans, sketches).

- It wouldn't be bad to have multiple windows. You could have several
  windows for different "worksets", e.g. one window to organize ideas, and
  other windows for stories related to each other (e.g. stories telling
  about the same character, same world, or stories aimed for a same
  writing competition)

- Linking: Linking URLs and for example docx/rtf background documents to
  a story.
  
- It wouldn't be bad to create "hub" documents or something like that: that
  is, if you have background material for certain characters or worlds,
  you could have a document/group collecting them together, so that you
  can easily access the background material and stories related to same
  character/world while sketching your stories.

- PM: Add context menu to open folder and with text editor.

- File open: Recursive file search like in nautilus

- File open: Add recent files
  
- File open: Allow users to make directories and create new files: now, if you
  make a new file, you first press New and then save it to correct
  folder with wanted name.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

QUIRKS, FIX:

- There is focusing problem at the moment in different places: for example,
  when closing tabs and so on. Now when shortcuts are bind to tab child, it
  is clearly visible.

- It is bit irritating that folding and unfolding cause buffer to become
  dirty, but it can't be helped now. Otherwise we are messing with undo/redo.

- Revert dialog looks really strange and confusing, because of focus
  style. "No" button is focused, but it looks like it is pressed down. Need
  to find better ways for indicating focus.

- Cut & paste folded scene headers has quirks: Consider these:

  * Cancel cut and paste, if selection contains protected areas
    (folded scenes)
    
  * Except if selection bounds are at scene bounds, that is, you
    have selected entire scenes.
    
- If you have selections (preferably whole scenes), make Alt-Up/Down
  move scenes with cursor.

- There are still quirks in folded content. It is possible to add new lines
  which will become hidden. Also, sometimes comment tags will get persistent.

- Scroll to mark after unfold does not work.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TODO:

- Code needs cleaning, refactoring and other such janitorial activities
  all over the place, to make room for new features. But let's schedule
  that work bit later.

- Improvements to Open/New View: many current software have it nicely
  decorated.

- It could be good to add hotkeys to tooltips. And yes, menus have their
  purpose showing the hotkeys.

- Would be great to have option to leave syopses unfolded

- Proposal: Determine suitable screen modes:
    
    Basic:
    (1) Draft index + draft view (edit draft)
    (2) Notes index + notes view (edit notes)
    (3) Notes view  + draft view (edit both side by side)

    These are almost like fold all + moving around:

    (4) XXX         + draft view/index (switch between index & edit)
    (5) notes view/index + XXX         (switch between index & edit)

- Cursor marks? For example, Alt-1 to place a mark, and Shit-Alt-1 to go
  back.

- Export: Texifier to version control

- Export: tex (for texifier)

- Revert: Make it load tree from file if doc has origin. This is for cases
  where file has changed in the disk.
  
- OnClose: Make it look if file was changed/deleted from disk.

- We could preserve e.g. "## **" to 'chapter' header. In fact, we need to
  make chapters. Just to prevent me using scenes as decorating items.

- Sticky pages? So that you could create your own checklists and such.

- Author and nickname could be behind radiobuttons, so that you can quickly
  switch between them.

- When starting Mawe first time (no config yet), make it open user's guide.

- Let user choose what tab to open on startup (where I left, open file,
  new, project manager)

- Some sort of "loopback" to test file saving and loading:
  save a file, and load it back to editor. It would be great if that
  would be as complete chain as possible. I have experience how nasty
  bugs are if they are in the document save part, making corrupted files.

- Drag'n'drop mawe and moe files to editor. In case you work with file
  manager or similar.

- Add error handling when loading documents

- Separate configs to local and global ones. For example, you may want
  to store workset configurations to a shared drive, but keep window settings
  on local machine.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LARGER FEATURES:

- Support for multi-part stories: Large stories - as well as their meta - may
  be split to multiple parts. There is some work to be done to make the parts
  to be managed fluently (splitting, merging, moving text between parts and
  so on). Remember, that it would be great if you can also split and merge
  stories themselves (to merge two stories together, or split a story to
  two separate stories).

- Versioning

- Mix buffers from several documents together in one view. That is, it is
  enough if we can choose between doc's draft and notes buffers.

- Compressed format? .mawe.gz - use gzip module to pack and unpack.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DONE:
