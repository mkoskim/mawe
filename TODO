FEATURES needed to start using the editor in daily work:

- Remember opened files

- Project search path

- File export: RTF, tex (for texifier)

- Settings editor

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other features:

- Author and nickname could be behind radiobuttons, so that you can quickly
  switch between them.

- Scroll to mark after unfold does not work.

- Also comments and missing word counts to project manager, to tell some
  idea of the status of the text.

- File open: Recursive file search like in nautilus

- File open: Add recent files
  
- File open: Allow users to make directories and create new files: now, if you
  make a new file, you first press New and then save it to correct
  folder with wanted name.

- Save: Get name suggestion from title

- When starting Mawe first time (no config yet), make it open help doc

- Let user choose what tab to open on startup (where I left, open file,
  new, project manager)

- Some sort of "loopback" device to test file saving and loading:
  save a file, and load it back to editor. It would be great if that
  would be as complete chain as possible. I have experience how nasty
  bugs are if they are in the document save part, making corrupted files.

- Drag'n'drop mawe and moe files to editor. In case you work with file
  manager or similar.

- Cursor marks? For example, Alt-1 to place a mark, and Shit-Alt-1 to go
  back.

- History entry to file: This can be used to track history, e.g.
  writing competitions where the text has been sent. <notes> part
  could be perfect for this!!!

- Save list of open tabs for restoring: remember check errors

- Add error handling when loading documents

- When choosing with grab, show the selections in the listbox

- Search and replace: it is very useful feature I have missed in moe a lot

- Separate configs to local and global ones. For example, you may want
  to store workset configurations to a shared drive, but keep window settings
  on local machine.

- Improvements to Open/New View: many current software have it nicely
  decorated.

- A synopsis editor would be cool, I think. I already sketched it with
  moe, but it has been underused.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Problematic issue: Single doc vs split view:

- In split view, you need lots of space for both docs.

- But when having just index at left, it can't fill the space.

- Could there be some sort of feature, "left" and "right" gutter for the
  doc:
  
  - When in single doc mode, both gutters are visible: index at left
  
  - When in split view, gutters are invisible and the pane is in different
    position.
    
  - Basically: We are not that interested in pane position: we are much
    more interested in doc view width!!!

  - Split view is absolutely mandatory feature.

  - Just find out some ideas for right gutter when split view is not
    used, and index is visible.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

QUIRKS, FIX:

- We can not just switch buffer to textview - Undo/redo will not work in
  that case. Instead, when switching buffers, we need to create new views.

- Cut & paste scene headers has quirks: Consider these:

  * Cancel cut and paste, if selection contains protected areas
    (folded scenes)
    
  * Except if selection bounds are at scene bounds, that is, you
    have selected entire scenes.
    
- Make:

  * Ctrl-up, Ctrl-down: move paragraph up / down
  
  * Alt-up, Alt-down: move scene up / down - if you have selections
    (preferably whole scenes), move scenes with cursor.

- I need to figure out suitable mechanics for managing hidden text tags.
  Whenever the scene header with "folded" mark is detached from hidden
  text, the hide tag should be removed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TODO:

- When we have loaded a moe file, it would be good if mawe would suggest
  to save it to same direction with .mawe extension. At least it could start
  from that directory. Lets make it so, that "Save" works as "Save as" if
  the file does not exist yet.

- Move listview's selected row when moving around the text

- Text <-> List swapping using Alt-left/right (instead of Alt-1/2 used at the
  moment)

- Selecting & moving scenes in listview

- Texifier to version control

- We could preserve e.g. "## **" to 'chapter' header. In fact, we need to
  make chapters. Just to prevent me using scenes as decorating items.

- Postpone: We can now support just one-part files

- Postpone: We don't need versioning yet.

- Postpone: We can live without being able to mix buffers from several
  documents together in one view. That is, it is enough if we can choose
  between doc's draft and notes buffers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DONE:

- DONE: Remember the directory where you were on open file directory between
  restarts. Not Done: Make it default to home directory - os.path does not
  regocnize "~", so it defaults to cwd().
  
- DONE: Project manager: It is first enough to have mawe files in moe project
  manager. But for workspaces and tabbed editing, we need built-in project
  manager.
