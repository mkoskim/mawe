SERIOUS ISSUES:

- GtkSourceView crashes randomly!!! Errors like this:
  (mawe.py:10556): Gtk-WARNING **: /build/gtk+3.0-2Ut_nl/gtk+3.0-3.18.9/./gtk/gtktextbtree.c:4034: byte index off the end of the line

  (mawe.py:10556): Gtk-ERROR **: Byte index 1362 is off the end of the line
  Trace/breakpoint trap

FIX:

- Move line (Alt-up, alt-down) does not work with markers. Moving
  header line over another will duplicate the mark.

- Moving folder scene will leave scene content behind

- Cut & paste scene headers has quirks: we might need to remove
  protection tag before cutting

DONE:

- DONE: Key combinations, e.g. Alt-A + Alt-F -> Fold all

- DONE: Fold / Unfold all
